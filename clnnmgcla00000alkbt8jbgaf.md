## **(Why) - The Power of A/B Testing**

‚úçÔ∏è Welcome to another day of my #100DaysOfDesign journey. Today, I'm diving into the world of A/B testing, a pivotal technique for data-driven design. Understanding user behavior, preferences, and optimizing user experiences is a core facet of UX design. A/B testing empowers designers and product teams to make informed decisions based on real user interactions, resulting in improved digital products.

## **(What) - Exploring VWO for A/B Testing**

‚úçÔ∏è The tool I'm using today is VWO (Visual Website Optimizer), an exceptional A/B testing tool that allows for experimentation and data-driven design decisions. Having previously relied on Google Optimize for my A/B testing endeavors, VWO emerges as a robust alternative since Google Optimize sunsetted. I'm thrilled to share my experience with VWO as I conduct a quick experiment on my UX portfolio site [karanbalaji.com](http://karanbalaji.com): "Consistent Button Labels vs. Dynamic Labels." This experiment will provide insights into the impact of button labels on user interactions.

üîç VWO offers both visual and code editors, requiring a familiarity with HTML and CSS to execute site modifications effectively. A key feature that piqued my interest is the ability to split live traffic between variations or opt for the new "Auto Split" feature, which gradually directs more traffic to the winning variant over time. My initial experience with VWO has been positive, and it appears to be a top-notch choice for A/B testing and data-driven design.

#### 1) Modifying the button labels using HTML:

#### 2) Creating the metrics/outcomes for this Experiment:

#### 3) Setting auto distribution of traffic that send more to winning variant
