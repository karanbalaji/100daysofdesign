 I started this challenge to create more projects and become a design technologist. Cloud computing knowledge has helped me solve problems within clicks. I wish to bring this knowledge to the industry so that they can focus on the User/customer experience.

Follow this challenge on my Github as I commit every day and post on Twitter.
