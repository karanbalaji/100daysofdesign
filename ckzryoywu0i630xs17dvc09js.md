First HashiCorp Toronto live event community meetup where I learned a lot about various cloud technologies such as terraform (IaaC). Thanks, Jacquie Grindrod for inviting me to the event. It was great meeting you all. And to Kyle Bassett and the team that hosted us at Arctiq Yes the pizza was amazing! Kudos to the Hashi team
