## **(What) - Exploring Visual Design with Hector Crespo**

## **(How) - How I Apply Visual Design Principles**

üñºÔ∏è Visual Design is more than aesthetics; it's a language that speaks to users. Inspired by Hector's wisdom, I've already started delving into these recommended books, seeking to enhance my design vocabulary.

One design system that resonates deeply with me is Google Material Design. Its emphasis on materiality, bold colours, and consistent motion truly aligns with my design philosophy. I believe in its power to create user interfaces that are not only beautiful but also intuitive.

During our chat, Hector and I also discussed my ongoing #100DaysOfDesign challenge, where I'm committed to continuous learning and growth in the world of design. It was inspiring to see his support and encouragement.

Furthermore, I took Hector's valuable feedback to heart and made enhancements to my UX portfolio. It's a living testament to the evolution of my skills and a reflection of the mentorship journey.

As I continue this incredible journey, I'm excited to explore the depths of visual design and its role in crafting memorable user experiences. The insights from Hector Crespo have ignited a new passion within me, and I can't wait to apply these fundamentals to my upcoming design projects.

Stay tuned for more discoveries, design innovations, and the continuous pursuit of excellence as I navigate the vast landscape of design.
