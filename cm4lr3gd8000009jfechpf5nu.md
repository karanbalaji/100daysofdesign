# **What is Changing?**

As AI continues to evolve, it’s making the process of creating products more accessible than ever. Today, with just an idea and the right tools, anyone can innovate and bring something to life. However, this newfound simplicity is shifting the challenge from *how to create* to *how to acquire and retain customers*. With the market flooded with similar offerings, standing out becomes the ultimate test—and communities might be the answer.

# **Why Communities Matter ( Removing Monopolies / Decentralizing Power )**

## **Trust Drives Consumer Choices**

One of the most influential factors in consumer decision-making is trust. People don’t just buy products; they buy into the individuals and brands behind them. Communities foster this trust through shared values, experiences, and open dialogue. When customers feel connected to a creator or brand, they’re more likely to support it—and stay loyal.

Take the example of potato chips. Imagine choosing between five nearly identical brands in a supermarket. Now imagine a friend or community member introduces a healthier, equally tasty, and slightly innovative option. You’d likely pick their product—not just because it’s better, but because you trust the person behind it. And if the product falls short, you’d feel empowered to give honest feedback, knowing it would be acted upon.

### **Faster Feedback Loops:**

Communities allow creators to receive direct, real-time feedback, unlike traditional businesses that rely on slow surveys or impersonal market research. This creates a fast feedback loop where products can be continuously refined.

For instance, if your friend’s potato chips were too salty, you could immediately let them know. They might tweak the recipe based on your input, improving the product while strengthening your trust in their responsiveness.

### **Emotional Differentiation:**

In an age of commoditization, products alone won’t set businesses apart. Emotional and social connections created through communities will be the true differentiators. Products backed by engaged communities represent more than functionality—they embody shared values, collaboration, and trust.

Platforms like **Patreon**, **Substack**, and **Heylo** already show how community-driven models flourish. Consumers are willing to pay a premium for products and services that align with their values and offer a deeper connection.

### **Applying Nash Equilibrium to Communities to remove abuse/power**

One fascinating concept that applies to communities is the **Nash Equilibrium**, a game theory principle that describes a state where no participant can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy. I’ve tested this theory in several run clubs in Toronto, starting with **Midnight Runners**, which grew to become the biggest run club in the city.

Here’s what happened: once Midnight Runners became too big, its leaders started exhibiting ego-driven behavior, forgetting that their power originated from the collective support of the community. As someone known in the community for my resilience and honesty, I became a "gladiator among runners," highlighting the importance of distribution over hierarchy.

When hierarchy led to disillusionment, many participants began leaving. I applied the Nash Equilibrium by encouraging people to explore other smaller, community-focused run clubs. This distributed the power among various groups, reducing the monopoly Midnight Runners once held. Eventually, as fewer people attended their runs, the leaders were forced to reflect and adapt to regain trust.

This experiment showed how power dynamics within communities can shift when trust is broken. The Nash Equilibrium ensures that when resources or attention are redistributed, monopolistic behaviors are naturally checked, fostering healthier competition and innovation.

## **How Can Creators Leverage Communities?**

1. **Start Small, Build Trust:** Begin by fostering a tight-knit group of early adopters. Trust grows through genuine engagement and responsiveness.
    
2. **Create a Feedback Loop:** Make feedback seamless and show customers you’re listening by acting on their suggestions.
    
3. **Highlight Shared Values:** Emphasize the values and mission behind your product. A strong narrative resonates with community members.
    
4. **Embrace Power Distribution:** Avoid centralizing power within a community. Foster collaborative leadership to maintain balance and inclusivity.
    
5. **Use Tools Effectively:** Leverage platforms like **Patreon**, **Heylo**, or even **Discord** to create meaningful engagement. For product refinement, tools like **Google Analytics**, **Hotjar**, and **Tag Manager** can provide data-backed insights into customer behavior.

## **Challenges of the Community-First Approach**

While the potential is vast, this model isn’t without hurdles:

* **Scalability:** As communities grow, maintaining trust and intimacy becomes challenging. Creators must innovate to keep the connection alive.
    
* **Transparency:** Communities demand openness and accountability, pushing creators to meet higher expectations.
    
* **Competition:** As more businesses adopt this model, standing out will require creativity and a unique value proposition.

## **The Future is Personal**

The future of commerce isn’t just about products—it’s about people. As AI democratizes creation, the human connection will become the key differentiator. Communities will foster trust, collaboration, and rapid iteration, transforming how creators and customers interact.

In this era of **outcome-driven design**, **community-centric business models**, and **balanced power dynamics**, creators must do more than deliver a product. They must nurture relationships, turn customers into collaborators, and build a shared future of trust and value.

This isn’t just a shift—it’s a movement. Are you ready to embrace it?

# Holding Companies Accountable: Documenting Rejection Feedback in Job Hunting

In the fast-paced world of job interviews, rejection is a common experience that many of us face. While rejection can be disappointing, it also offers a chance for growth and improvement. However, there’s an ongoing issue that often goes unnoticed—the lack of transparency and accountability in the recruitment process. How many times have you been rejected after a rigorous interview process without receiving meaningful feedback? Or worse, have you ever felt like your ideas and insights were used during interviews only to be discarded without acknowledgment?

## The Power of Transparency

As a firm believer in the importance of feedback and continuous improvement, I’ve found it crucial to document and share the feedback I receive from companies during the interview process. Whether it's a rejection or a thank-you note without specific reasons, I make it a point to ask for detailed feedback. I think this feedback is not only valuable for my personal growth but also for the companies I engage with to improve their hiring practices. By sharing this feedback publicly, I create a space for accountability—both for myself as a candidate and for the companies involved in the process.

## A Transparent Process

When I document my interview experiences, I don't just keep them for personal reference. I share these insights with my community. This open dialogue ensures that my experiences as a candidate aren’t dismissed or forgotten. If I’ve been rejected based on certain skills or qualifications, I want to understand why, and I believe that companies owe candidates this level of transparency. This helps everyone: candidates refine their skill set, and companies get the feedback they need to improve their processes and interactions with candidates.

## Preventing the Misuse of Ideas

In some instances, candidates feel as though their ideas or solutions are used in interviews only to be rejected without explanation. The same solutions and insights they provided during the interview process may later appear in the company’s roadmap, with no recognition of the candidate’s contribution. This isn't just a matter of bad luck; it's a misuse of intellectual property that, in many cases, goes unaddressed.

To prevent this, I ensure that any work, feedback, or ideas shared during an interview are documented publicly. This can take the form of blog posts, social media updates, or even direct feedback to the company. By keeping track of these interactions, I create a record that holds companies accountable for how they use candidate input.

## The Voice of the Customer (Candidate) Matters

At the core of this approach is the concept of empowering candidates to have a voice. Just as businesses listen to their customers, they should listen to the candidates they engage with during the hiring process. This creates a system where both parties can benefit from transparency, trust, and mutual respect. By documenting the feedback and sharing the process publicly, I ensure that companies are held accountable for their recruitment practices while also fostering a community that supports each other through the challenges of job hunting.

In today’s competitive job market, it’s crucial that companies not only seek the right candidates but also treat them with the respect and fairness they deserve. The process of documenting feedback, sharing insights, and holding companies accountable can foster a culture of transparency, fairness, and improvement for all parties involved.
