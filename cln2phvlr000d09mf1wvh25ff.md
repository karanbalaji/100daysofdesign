## **(Why) - The Art and Science of Typography**

‚úçÔ∏è On Day 17 of my #100DaysOfDesign journey, we dive deep into the world of typography. Typography isn't just about choosing pretty fonts; it's the art and science of arranging text in a way that's not only visually appealing but also highly readable and effective.

## **(What) - Unlocking Typography Terms**

‚úçÔ∏è To navigate this world, I turn to the insightful resource by Nielsen Norman Group: [**Typography Terms for UX Designers: A Glossary**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/typography-terms-ux/). This comprehensive glossary demystifies typography terms that are essential in the realm of web design and CSS, including:

1. **Kerning**: Adjusting the space between individual characters.
    
2. **Baseline**: The invisible line upon which most characters "sit."
    
3. **Serif**: Typefaces with decorative lines at the ends of characters.
    
4. **Sans-serif**: Typefaces without those decorative lines.
    
5. **Leading**: The vertical space between lines of text.
    
6. **Widows and Orphans**: Terms related to the last line of a paragraph spilling over to the next page.
    
7. **Tracking**: Adjusting overall spacing between characters.
    
8. **X-Height**: The height of lowercase letters without ascenders or descenders.
    
9. **Hierarchy**: Using different sizes, weights, and styles to create visual contrast and emphasize certain text.
    
10. **Ligature**: The combination of two or more characters into a single character for improved readability.
    

Understanding these terms is like having a secret key to better design, especially when dealing with CSS for web design.

For practical insights, I also found an article about creating a typography system in Figma: [**Creating a Typography System in Figma**](https://uxplanet.org/creating-a-typography-system-in-figma-9aff3da21228), which offers valuable guidance on implementing typography in design.

## **(How) - Applying Typography Know-How**

üñºÔ∏è The world of web design relies heavily on CSS, and these typography terms are not just jargon; they are the building blocks of text presentation. Understanding them can be the difference between a cluttered, unreadable webpage and one that draws users in and guides them seamlessly through content.

## **(Why It Matters) - Typography's Impact on User Experience**

üåü Typography plays a profound role in shaping the user experience. It affects not just the aesthetics of a design but also the readability and comprehension of the content. Whether it's a website, app, or any digital product, mastering typography is a crucial step toward creating designs that resonate with users.

As I continue on this design journey, I'll be leaning on this typography cheat sheet to ensure that every piece of text I present is not just visually pleasing but also user-centric.
