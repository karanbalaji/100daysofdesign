## **(Why) - Understanding Data Dynamics**

‚úçÔ∏è Today, I had the privilege of attending an enlightening fireside chat by [adplist.org](https://app.adplist.org/) with Julie Zhuo, former VP of Product Design at Facebook and co-founder of Sundial. Julie delved into the nuances between data-driven and data-informed decisions, emphasizing the importance of context and empathy in design.

## **(What) - Unpacking Insights**

‚úçÔ∏è Julie's insights shed light on the role of data as a guiding force rather than a sole determinant in decision-making. She highlighted the need for a unified approach, where data serves as a tool for understanding and informing design choices, ultimately complementing the empathetic lens of designers.

## **(How) - Embracing AI in Design**

üõ†Ô∏è Furthermore, Julie shared her vision for the future of design with AI, envisioning it as a transformative tool that streamlines manual tasks and amplifies human creativity. As Steve Jobs famously said, "It's a bicycle for our minds," AI promises to enhance our design processes, enabling us to focus on the impactful aspects of problem-solving.

In this dynamic landscape, where data and AI intersect with human ingenuity, the possibilities for innovation are boundless. Julie's insights serve as a compass, guiding us toward a future where design is not just about pixels and screens but about meaningful impact and problem-solving.
