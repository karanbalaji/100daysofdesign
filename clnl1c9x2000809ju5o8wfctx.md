## (Why) - Mastering the Art of Design Interviews

ðŸŒŸ *Why should we delve into the world of design interviews?* Design interviews are not just about answering questions; they are gateways to career opportunities and personal growth. Today, we embark on a journey to master the art of design interviews. These interviews are our compass, guiding us toward meaningful roles in the design world. *Join me as I share invaluable insights from my mentorship session with Alex Small, a distinguished Staff Interaction Designer and Design Manager at Google.*

## (What) - Key Insights for Success

ðŸ’¡ *What's the secret to mastering design interviews?* It all begins with the "what." During my mentorship with Alex Small, I gained essential tips for excelling in design interviews. We uncovered the importance of asking "why" before diving into design problems. Understanding the purpose of our solutions and their intended audience forms the foundation of success. We explored constraints and measurable outcomes, such as conversion rates and installs, as our guiding stars. Alex emphasized the value of an open mind, fostering the generation of multiple ideas and welcoming feedback. But the most powerful revelation was the idea of voicing our thoughts. Sharing our problem-solving process during interviews provides interviewers with a profound understanding of our mindset, transforming a standard interview into a dynamic conversation.

## (How) - Applying Design Interview Mastery

ðŸŒ† *How do we apply the insights gained in design interviews to our own journey?* After my mentorship session with Alex Small, I was inspired to put these design interview techniques into practice. I realized that design interviews aren't just a formality but a valuable opportunity to showcase our problem-solving abilities and design thinking.

âœ… I began incorporating the "why" into my design process, ensuring that I understand the problem thoroughly and the intended audience. I started considering constraints and measurable outcomes, aligning my design solutions with specific metrics. This approach allowed me to create designs that not only look good but also solve real problems effectively.
