AWS Toronto summit 2019, was my first and I believe I was the youngest to attend. I had an amazing time guided by my mentor Andrew Brown and got to meet other amazingly talented people such as Jacquelyne Grindrod and Jeremy Lundy. I had an amazing company talking about various perspectives in tech with these talented people.

I got to access the AWS certified lounge exclusively for anyone who passed a certification. We also got lots of AWS freebies for the certified folks. Thank you AWS, you were #AWSome

Thank you all. I would definitely go again in the future.
