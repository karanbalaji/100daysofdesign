During the Rogers Canada-wide outages, I discovered that AWS has a private 5g service that allows you to quickly deploy, manage, and scale a private cellular network.

Although I was excited if it would be for the individual consumers, it currently focuses more on businesses or venues that rely on the high availability of networks.
