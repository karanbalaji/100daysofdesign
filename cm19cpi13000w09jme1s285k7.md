## **What: Building a Minimum Lovable Product (MLP)**

**During the BeMore Festival by ADPList, Sunil Subramanian shared his insights on creating a Minimum Lovable Product (MLP). While many product creators focus on building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), Sunil emphasizes the importance of not just functionality, but delight, engagement, and connection with users.**

### **Moving Beyond MVP to MLP**

**The concept of MVP centers around getting a product out the door with basic functionality. However, a Minimum Lovable Product goes beyond this by ensuring that the product is not only functional but also creates an emotional connection with users. An MLP stands out through simplicity, power, delight, and community.**

## **How: The Key Elements for Creating an MLP**

### **4 Key Traits for an MLP:**

1. **Simple: The product must be clear, easy to understand, and complete in its core function. Complexity can drive users away, so simplicity is key.**
    
2. **Powerful: Like Apple's iPod tagline, "1,000 songs in your pocket," the product should provide a powerful, memorable message that resonates with users.**
    
3. **Delightful: First impressions matter. The product must be visually appealing and delightful upon first glance or use.**
    
4. **Tribal Effect: Like the excitement surrounding Apple product launches, the MLP should generate excitement among a community of users who love the product and eagerly anticipate its release.**
    

### **Metrics for Measuring Success**

**Sunil highlighted that the key metrics for a Minimum Lovable Product depend on the business stage:**

* **Explore Phase: At this stage, you’re looking for engagement metrics rather than conversion rates. Measure how users interact with your product before optimizing for other KPIs.**
    
* **Expansion Phase: When expanding, look at Monthly Active Users (MAU) and Daily Active Users (DAU) to gauge the product's traction.**
    

**Ultimately, engagement is often a more meaningful metric than conversion alone, as it reflects how well the product resonates with users.**

### **Essential Traits for Building MLPs**

**Sunil outlined five essential traits to consider when building an MLP:**

1. **You Can't Know What Customers Want: Start by understanding your users' "why" and focus on solving their problem—not just any problem.**
    
2. **Discovery Over Delivery: Stick to a two-week rule for product iterations. Separate the problem and solution space, and always aim for the product to be valuable, feasible, and usable.**
    
3. **Data Over Opinions: Data should guide product decisions. Never launch without analytics, but be data-informed, not data-driven, to maintain flexibility.**
    
4. **Pivots Over Plans: It’s important to iterate quickly, about 5-15 times per week if necessary. Vision pivots can be more powerful than simply sticking to rigid plans.**
    
5. **Culture Over Process: Validate ideas early, and aim for the fastest and cheapest ways to test hypotheses before running out of resources.**

    **Be a Good Listener: Don't just listen to customers—listen to your team. Collaboration within your team can spark new solutions or insights.**
    
2. **Solve the Highest-Value Problem: Focus on how to incentivize customers effectively by addressing the most valuable pain points.**
    
3. **Validate Your Riskiest Assumptions: When you have 1,000 ideas, test the riskiest assumption first to mitigate failure and focus resources on what matters.**
    
4. **Differentiators Matter: When many products are similar, strong differentiators are crucial to stand out in the market.**
    
5. **Target the Right Customer Segment: Correctly segmenting your customer base is vital for ensuring that you are solving the right problems for the right people.**
    
6. **Identify Magic Moments: Look for moments in the customer journey that stand out—these can be leveraged to create loyalty and excitement around your product.**

### **My Q&A: What are the key metrics for Minimum Lovable Product**

Sunil emphasized that the top metrics for an MLP can vary depending on the project, business model, and its stage of development. For instance, during the exploration phase or the expansion stage, different priorities may arise. However, one of the most universally important metrics is ***engagement***, often considered more critical than just focusing on conversions. Other important ones are Monthly Active Users (MAUs), or Daily Active Users (DAUs).

## **Conclusion: Building a Product People Love**

**Building a Minimum Lovable Product requires more than just functionality; it involves creating a product that is simple, powerful, delightful, and loved by a community. By focusing on the right traits, listening to both your team and customers, and using data to drive decisions, you can create products that don't just work—but that people love.**
