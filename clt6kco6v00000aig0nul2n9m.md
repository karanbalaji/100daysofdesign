Vitaly Friedman emphasizes the importance of strategically aligning design with business objectives to enhance the value of design within a business context. This strategic alignment not only demonstrates the tangible impact of design decisions but also ensures these decisions are measurable and directly contribute to business success. A prime example Friedman showcases to illustrate this concept involves a multi-tiered approach to KPIs, which bridges the gap between business metrics and design initiatives:

* * **Business KPI:** Referral Rate - A key performance indicator that tracks the effectiveness of users referring others to the product.
        
        \* **Design KPI:** Average Recommendation per User in a Month - This metric delves deeper into the user behavior, specifically focusing on how design influences the likelihood of recommendations.
        
        \* **Measure:** Percentage of Users Who Have Referred at Least 1 Person to Our Products Over the Last 6 Months - This measure provides a clear, quantifiable insight into referral rates over a significant period, offering a direct link to the effectiveness of design strategies.
        
        \* **Design Initiative:** Improve Branding Perception by Featuring Successful Case Studies - This actionable initiative aims to enhance the product's branding perception, thereby increasing referral rates. By showcasing successful case studies, the design directly contributes to a positive brand image, encouraging more users to make referrals.
        
        This example perfectly encapsulates how design KPIs can be meticulously mapped to business KPIs, ensuring that every design initiative is not only aligned with but actively contributes to the overarching business goals. Through such strategic alignment, design transcends its traditional boundaries, becoming a pivotal driver of business success
        

## **(How) Implementing Friedman's Visionary Strategies**

### **Building and Nurturing Relationships**

* **Proactive Relationship Building:** Seeking opportunities for meaningful connections and being accessible for collaboration.
    
* **Creating a Supportive Community:** The importance of a dynamic and supportive design community.
    

### Decoding the Dialogue: The Contrast Between Business and UX Language in Design Strategy

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1709170542417/60174a8e-0201-48da-91fe-225e2d10c54c.png align="center")

In this insightful snapshot from a Fireside Chat with Vitaly Friedman, we're presented with a compelling comparison between Business language and UX language. The image highlights how the vocabulary we choose can significantly impact our approach to design and user experience. On one side, we see Business language with aggressive terms such as "Conquer," "Capture," and "Destroy," which reflect a combative and market-driven focus. On the flip side, UX language uses nurturing terms like "Reduce friction," "Empower users," and "Develop empathy," indicating a more user-centered approach that aims to create an inclusive and supportive customer experience. This contrast not only showcases the distinct mindsets of business versus user experience but also emphasizes the importance of aligning our communication with our design and business goals.

### **Bonus Figma: Embracing a Strategic Design Framework**

* **Disciplined Planning and Execution:** The need for meticulous planning, from crafting detailed SOWs to aligning design KPIs with business goals.
    
* **Design Strategy Canvas:** Utilizing tools like Friedman's design strategy canvas for visual roadmap and alignment with broader business strategies.
