## **(Why) - A Vision of Tomorrow's Design**

ðŸš€ Today was a remarkable journey into the fascinating world of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in product design. With Marisa Parker, Senior Design Manager at AWS (AI/ML), as my mentor, I delved deep into the possibilities that lie ahead. We explored how generative AI can revolutionize our approach to design, paving the way for a new era of innovation.

## **(What) - AWS Bedrock: A Foundation to Brainstorming & Creativity**

ðŸ’¡ In the spotlight was AWS Bedrock, a game-changing tool that's making waves in the design landscape. It offers the capability to build and scale generative AI applications with foundation models. As a product designer, the question becomes: How can we harness these tools to amplify our design process? In my article, I will share my journey and the methodologies I used to leverage AWS Bedrock for user interview research. By taking notes and crafting prompts, I harnessed the power of generative AI to analyze complex design problems and unearth exciting opportunities.

### **The Creative Edge:**

Beyond research, generative AI empowers us to generate personalized content tailored to user personas. Imagine effortlessly conjuring an infinite array of ideas, streamlining brainstorming sessions, and refining rough drafts. The potential for innovation is boundless.

## **(How) - Envisioning the Future**

ðŸ”® Looking forward, I envision generative AI tools offering real-time personalization based on the characteristics and needs of target visitors. Think about it: content that adapts instantly and seamlessly to the user's location, preferences, and even local events.

ðŸŒŽ Consider the game-changing potential of such a system. For instance, during Thanksgiving in Canada and later on in the USA, generative AI could craft content that's not only geolocation-sensitive but also relevant to the specific events happening around the user. This level of personalization could redefine user experiences, making them more engaging, informative, and immersive.

Stay tuned for a glimpse into the extraordinary journey of harnessing AI for creativity and design!) ðŸŽ¨âœ¨ #ProductDesign #AIInnovation #GenerativeAI #DesignRevolution
