## **(Why) - An Introduction to the Significance of Accessibility in UX**

‚úçÔ∏è On Day 11 of my #100DaysOfDesign journey, I embarked on a critical exploration of accessibility design in UX. The driving force behind this endeavour is the firm belief that inclusivity should be at the heart of every design. Here's a glimpse into the world of accessible UX.

## **(What) - Unveiling the Tools and Tips for Accessibility Design**

‚úçÔ∏è Accessibility in UX design is not just a compliance requirement; it's a moral imperative. It's about ensuring that everyone, regardless of their abilities, can access and use digital products seamlessly.

In my pursuit of creating inclusive designs, I've discovered a range of tools and strategies that have become invaluable (Link: [accessScan](https://accessibe.com/accessscan)):

* **Colour Contrast Checkers:** Tools like the WCAG Color Contrast Checker help me ensure that text and graphics have sufficient contrast for readability.
    
* **Screen Readers:** I've dived into the world of screen readers to understand how visually impaired users interact with digital content. This knowledge has profoundly influenced my design choices.
    
* **Keyboard Navigation:** I've learned to prioritize keyboard navigation as a fundamental element of UX, ensuring that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard input.
    
* **Semantic HTML:** Properly structured HTML goes a long way in enhancing screen reader compatibility and overall accessibility.
    
* **User Testing:** Conducting user testing with individuals who have disabilities has been enlightening. Their feedback guides me in making necessary adjustments to improve accessibility.
    

## **(How) - A Valuable Discovery: The Accessibility Study Guide**

üìö As part of my ongoing quest for knowledge, I stumbled upon a treasure trove of insights: the "Accessibility & Inclusivity Study Guide" by Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g). This comprehensive guide serves as a roadmap for diving deep into accessibility and inclusivity in UX design.

The guide covers a multitude of topics, from understanding user needs to implementing inclusive design principles. It's not just a resource; it's a commitment to making the digital world a more inclusive place.

## **(Why It Matters) - The Essence of Inclusive Design**

üåü Accessibility in UX design isn't an optional extra; it's at the core of creating exceptional user experiences. It's about extending a welcoming hand to every user, regardless of their abilities.

As I continue on my #100DaysOfDesign journey, my commitment to accessibility remains unwavering. I believe that design should be a force for positive change, and inclusivity is a significant step toward achieving that goal.
