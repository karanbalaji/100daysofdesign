## **(Why) - An Introduction to My Journey into Information Architecture**

‚úçÔ∏è On Day 6 of my #100DaysOfDesign journey, I'm excited to explore the intricate realm of Information Architecture. This discipline plays a pivotal role in crafting user-friendly digital experiences. Thanks to the guidance of my mentor, Cristina Lutcan, I'm diving deep into this topic, armed with top 10 design principles.

## **(What) - Unveiling the Secrets of Information Architecture**

‚úçÔ∏è Information Architecture is the art of organizing and structuring information in a way that makes it accessible and understandable to users. It's the backbone of intuitive navigation and seamless user journeys. To excel in this field, I'm embracing the following design principles:

1. **Clarity:** Keep it simple and straightforward.
    
2. **Consistency:** Maintain uniformity in labelling and navigation.
    
3. **Hierarchy:** Prioritize content based on importance. (Tip: How users search you on Google)
    
4. **Accessibility:** Ensure information is accessible to all users. (WCAG, AODA-Ontario)
    
5. **Efficiency:** Optimize search and retrieval processes.
    
6. **Flexibility:** Accommodate evolving user needs.
    
7. **User-Centricity:** Design for the user, not the organization.
    
8. **Feedback:** Collect and act on user feedback.
    
9. **Scalability:** Plan for growth and expansion.
    
10. **Collaboration:** Involve stakeholders in decision-making.
    

## **(How) - How I Approach Information Architecture**

üñºÔ∏è My personal approach to Information Architecture goes beyond the traditional methods. In addition to user interviews and cross-departmental collaboration, I delve into Google Insights through tools like Google Search Console and Google Keyword Planner.

Google Search Console provides valuable insights into the actual search queries that lead users to my website. It's a treasure trove of information that helps me understand user intentions and preferences.

I also use Google Keyword Planner to identify popular keywords related to my website's content. This tool offers data on search volume, competition, and related keywords, enabling me to align my content with what users are actively searching for.

Moreover, I employ tools like FigJam for visual mapping, fostering collaboration within the team and ensuring that our IA aligns with user expectations.

As I continue on my #100DaysOfDesign journey, Information Architecture remains a cornerstone of my work. It's the key to creating digital spaces that not only look good but also deliver an exceptional user experience. I'm thrilled to apply these principles and insights to refine my IA skills further.

Stay tuned for more insights, discoveries, and design innovations as I explore the world of design and user experience through the lens of Information Architecture.
