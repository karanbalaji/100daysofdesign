#### What: Understanding Guy Kawasaki's Journey

**A Remarkable Journey**

Guy Kawasaki's life is a testament to overcoming challenges with a positive outlook. Despite living with Meniere's disease, which causes hearing loss and vertigo, Guy remains humble and thankful. He grew up in a lower-middle-class family, and his parents' emphasis on education significantly shaped his path. Dropping out of law school after just two weeks, he attributes his success to the strong educational foundation his parents provided.

Growing up in Hawaii, a place rich in racial and cultural diversity, also influenced his perspective on life. The diversity of his environment taught him to appreciate different viewpoints and fostered a broader understanding of the world.

**Connecting the Dots**

Reflecting on his journey, Guy often quotes Steve Jobs: "You can only connect the dots looking backwards." This perspective became clear when he saw his friends driving Porsches and Rolls Royces, motivating him to study hard and strive for success. His experience at Theranos taught him a crucial lesson: we must question authority and understand that wisdom and insight can come from anyone, regardless of their position or background.

**Growth Mindset and Grit**

Guy believes that while some people naturally possess a growth mindset, not everyone can develop it to the same extent. A growth mindset is about believing that with effort and determination, one can achieve almost anything. However, external factors and environments significantly influence this mindset.

**Cultivating a Growth Mindset Environment**

Guy emphasizes that the environment in which we are raised plays a crucial role in developing a growth mindset. In societies where failure is punished, and traditional career paths like government jobs or medicine are prioritized, individuals might feel restricted. Conversely, in environments that encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, people are more likely to adopt a growth mindset.

**Defining Grit**

Grit, according to Guy, is the ability to keep going when things are no longer easy or fun. It's about showing up consistently and persevering through challenges. Combining perseverance with grit and resilience can propel individuals to achieve their goals and continue growing, even in the face of adversity. Guy encapsulates this philosophy with the mantra: Growth, Grit, and Grace.
