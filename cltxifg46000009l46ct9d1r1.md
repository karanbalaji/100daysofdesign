### **Designing for a Better World**

Norman's call to action is clear: designers have a profound opportunity, and responsibility, to contribute to a better world. By adopting a holistic, interdisciplinary approach and focusing on humanitarian outcomes, designers can address the root causes of global challenges. Norman's vision extends beyond traditional design thinking, advocating for a world where design is a catalyst for positive change, balancing human needs with the health of our planet and society.

As we reflect on Norman's insights, it becomes evident that the future of design lies in our ability to adapt, learn, and apply our skills towards creating sustainable, ethical, and universally beneficial solutions. The path forward is not just about aesthetics or usability; it's about leveraging design as a powerful tool for social and environmental stewardship.

## My Question To Don Norman

In a thrilling exchange during the fireside chat with Don Norman, I had the opportunity to ask a question that delves deep into the intersection of design and other disciplines. My inquiry was, 'Considering coding, psychology, anthropology, cognitive neuroscience, and behavioral economics, which do you believe would most effectively complement my design skills, or is there another area you'd suggest?'

A huge thank you to everyone who voted for my question, which Don Norman elaborated on during his talk. He emphasized the importance of learning about people not only through disciplines like anthropology and psychology but also from novelists who observe and write about the simple, everyday aspects of human behaviour, such as why people scratch or dance.

This interaction was a highlight for me, spotlighting the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge in pushing the boundaries of design thinking.

## (Meme) The Matrix of Design

In a moment of profound realization, Don Norman gazes out his window and observes a world entirely crafted by human hands. This epiphany highlights the artificial nature of our surroundings, underscoring the pivotal role of design in shaping our reality. This reflection leads Norman to delve deeper into history, seeking the roots of design principles that have guided human innovation over centuries.

This journey of discovery echoes the iconic scene from "The Matrix," where the protagonist is offered a choice between the red pill and the blue pill—a decision between embracing the harsh truths of reality or remaining in the comfort of blissful ignorance. Norman's moment of realization is akin to choosing the red pill, embarking on a quest to understand the historical and artificial constructs of our world.

Through this lens, Norman posits that the essence of design lies not just in the creation of aesthetically pleasing or functional objects but in the profound understanding of humanity's history and artificial constructs. This perspective challenges us to think beyond the surface, urging designers to consider the broader implications of their work on society and the environment.

By weaving together the threads of history, human behavior, and design, Norman invites us to view our role as designers in a new light. We are not just creators of objects or experiences but architects of the future, with the power to shape the world in ways that resonate with the deepest aspects of human existence.

As we ponder Norman's insights, we are reminded of the power of design to transcend the artificial, to question the status quo, and to forge a path towards a more thoughtful, humanitarian-centric future. In this "Matrix" of design, every decision, every creation, has the potential to redefine our world and our place within it.
