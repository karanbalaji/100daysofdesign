## **(Why) Embracing the Future of Spatial Design**

Immerse in the dynamic potential of mixed reality as Andrew Eiche articulates its power to provide exploratory realms for users. Encounter the candid revelations from Stefan about the opaque challenges of transitioning UX from devices to Vision Pro‚Äîacknowledging a new, yet unrefined paradigm.

## **(What) Illuminating Insights from the Experts**

### **Andrew Eiche: The Mixed Reality Advocate**

* **Mixed Reality as an Exploration Realm:** Eiche illuminates the immersive experiences offered by mixed reality, urging developers to harness this potential.
    
* **Communication is Key:** He challenges developers to engage actively with forums, asserting that collective problem-solving can expedite development processes.
    

### **Stefan: The UX Pathfinder**

* **Navigating the Uncharted:** Stefan shares the struggles of working 'in the dark' with new technologies, emphasizing the importance of streamlined UX in emerging paradigms.
    
* **Human-Centric Interaction:** He advocates for prioritizing native human interaction‚Äîhand and eye movements‚Äîas the cornerstone of exceptional UX.
    

### **Xander McCarthy: The Pragmatic Developer**

* **Risk and Resource Management:** McCarthy's approach to app development focuses on prudent risk management and cautions against overcommitment in unfamiliar areas.
    

## **(How) Navigating the Evolution of Design**

As we chart the course of spatial design's evolution, let's embrace the insights from the Unity Apple Vision Pro conference. With a focus on innovation, collaboration, and the savvy use of emergent technologies, we forge ahead.

### **The UX/UI Conundrum**

Andrew Eiche praises Apple's implementation of the pinch gesture, advising designers to appreciate each interaction's uniqueness and avoid treating it as a mere substitute for grabbing. He also underscores the importance of ergonomic design in 3D spaces, considering the physicality of user interactions.

### **Design Readings and Resources**

* **Ergonomics in Interaction:** Explore the physicality of design, where touch, feel, grab, and pinch are not just functions but experiences that require thoughtful ergonomic consideration.
    
* **Recommended Reading:** Delve into "The Design of Everyday Things" for an in-depth understanding of usability and human-centered design principles.
    
* **Exploring Unity's Tools:** Eiche points to Unity's Interaction Framework and the XR Interaction Toolkit as resources to better grasp interaction design's nuances, despite challenges like non-customizable hover states due to privacy concerns.
    

### **The Vision of Spatial Computing**

Andrew traces the lineage of spatial computing, likening Apple's foray into the space as a first-generation device reminiscent of the Apple II‚Äîpioneering yet rudimentary. Apple's commitment to spatial design hints at a future where our entire environment becomes an interface, with hand, eye, pinch, and grab tracking heralding a new mainstream wave.
