## **(Why) - An Introduction to why I attended the EvolveUX Conference**

‚úçÔ∏è I attended the EvolveUX Conference, a gathering focused on UX and design systems, with the aim of gaining a deeper understanding of the common challenges associated with adopting and maintaining design systems.

## **(What) - What did I learn about Design Systems?**

‚úçÔ∏è Today's insights reinforced my belief in the power of established design systems. As an avid supporter of Google Material Design, I've long recognized its comprehensive research on accessibility, usage, and more. It's a reminder that, in the world of design systems, embracing what works efficiently can be a game-changer.

## **(How) - How did I improve today?**

üñºÔ∏è Thanks to the wisdom shared at the conference, I learned about essential tools for managing design systems, including [**Storybook**](https://storybook.js.org/), Brandpad, and Frontify. Additionally, I gained a crucial understanding: of the importance of aligning with popular design systems to stay current with industry trends, rather than starting from scratch.

As I continue on my #100DaysOfDesign journey, these lessons from the EvolveUX Conference are shaping my path toward becoming a more effective and informed designer.

## **Social Proof**

‚úçÔ∏è To showcase my commitment to growth, I shared my mentorship journey on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/karanbalaji_day-2100-in-100daysofdesign-demystifying-activity-7106107003944529920-cSjS?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
