## **(Why) - Embracing the Double Diamond**

‚úçÔ∏è Today, my design journey led me to a valuable mentorship session with Wenting Zhu, a Senior Design Researcher and strategist at Walmart. We delved into the intriguing realm of the double-diamond design thinking process. The journey of understanding and mastering this process was indeed enlightening.

## **(What) - Demystifying the Phases**

‚úçÔ∏è The double diamond process comprises four distinct phases: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver. As Wenting elaborated, it's not a mere checklist to follow but a dynamic journey that adapts to the unique scenarios of each product or company. It lacks a standard structure or one-size-fits-all solution.

* **Discover (Data Collection)**: In this phase, we immerse ourselves in data collection. But it's more than just gathering information; it's about understanding the problem deeply.
    
* **Define (Data Analysis)**: Data analysis is a pivotal stage. To improve this phase, Wenting recommended validating data through surveys, open-ended questions, word associations in interviews, and crafting a problem statement with a compelling story.
    
* **Develop**: This stage involves various tasks like wireframing, storyboarding, toolkit design, and service design. Again, it's about tailoring the approach to the specific problem.
    
* **Deliver**: The final phase involves designing and testing prototypes. It's not merely about fulfilling a checklist but about continually evaluating and testing to ensure that the design effectively addresses the problems identified in the earlier phases.

## **(How) - Adaptation and Evolution**

üå± Wenting's insightful advice underscored the adaptability and evolution inherent in the double diamond process. While many companies may already complete the first two phases, the goal of the latter two phases isn't just about fulfilling a process but about relentless evaluation and design improvement.

It's all about asking whether the problem identified in the initial phases is accurate and, more importantly, if the design effectively solves it. This was a crucial lesson‚Äîconstantly refining and evolving design solutions, not merely following a predefined path.

As my mentorship journey continues, I find myself inspired by the flexibility and dynamism of design thinking, as guided by the double-diamond process. In a world where one size doesn't fit all, this approach offers an invaluable compass to navigate the complex landscape of design.
